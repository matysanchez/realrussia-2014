        <p>We have started "Real Russia" in September, 2012 as just a videoblog about our real life in Ufa, Russia in September.</p>
        <p>In the beginning we never knew if our channel will be interesting enough for a lot of people all over the World. Nobody could give us an answer because we were the first ones who tried this concept. So we just gave it a try and since that moment never stopped.</p>
        <p>Recently since September, 2012 we've filmed 71 episodes of "Real Russia", Sergey Baklykov got his gall bladder removed and Sergey Grom got married and his wife already bore him a son.</p>
        <p>But another important thing is that we became more important for our audience as we ever could imagine. It's absolutely obvious we are making the right thing and you're always expect more from us and more about Russia for burning more bridges between our country and the rest of the World.</p>
        <p>It's a fact that we've filmed a lot of good episodes in our homecity Ufa, the capital of Bashkortostan Republic of Russia, but it's time to move forward and relocate to Moscow, the heart and capital of Russia where we can meet everything and everyone - from illegal immigrants to President of Russia.</p>
        <p>Moscow is where you can be on a pulse of Russian Life and it's the better way to start making coverage of all over Russia starting from it.</p>
        <p>So we had two choices - to keep filming a local episodes in Ufa or to move to Moscow to start a great coverage of Russia. We've bet on a second choice!</p>
        <p>For this reason, right now it's a historical moment when we are, Sergey Baklykov and Sergey Grom, making a serious step - we place everything on a map! We leave everything we have in Ufa and move to Moscow. Yes, we move to Moscow. Not just going to visit as we did at spring of 2013.</p>
        <p>For this purpose we've got a loan in amount of $14,000.</p>
        <p>We need this money to move to Moscow, find an apartment for rent there, to buy a new equpment like new camera Blackmagic that film in 2.5K format and gives absolutely great quality of the picture, lenses, steadycam and other.</p>
        <p>All of this we do special and only for "Real Russia" and as a fact for you as for our audience.</p>
        <p>And we'll be more than happy if you'll help us and support our channel with your donations. All money will go to return the money we loaned.</p>
        <p>Thank you for watching and supporting us!</p>
        <p>Everything just begins! Moscow is forward!</p>
